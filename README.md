This is a [DecentSDK](https://docs.decent.xyz) + [RainbowKit](https://rainbowkit.com) + [wagmi](https://wagmi.sh) + [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-rainbowkit`](https://github.com/rainbow-me/rainbowkit/tree/main/packages/create-rainbowkit).

The purpose of this repository is to get you up & running quickly with the Decent SDK (@decent.xyz/sdk).  The primary functionality demonstrated in this repo is the ability to deploy Decent's 721A smart contract and fetch the address.  The deployment function used here can be copied to launch each of the other contracts included in the SDK.  This repository also demonstrates the Metadata Renderer module.
